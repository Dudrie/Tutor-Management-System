:::note Administration credentials

If you log in the first time with your provided credentials you are prompted to change initial password. You **have to** change it before you can proceed! The new password must fullfil all requirements noted in the box on the page as seen on the image below.

:::warning Remember your password
There is currently no system in place that lets you request a new password if you forget yours so remember it (or use a password manager for example). If you should forget your password you have to ask your administrator to create a new one for you (which you then have to change on your next login).
